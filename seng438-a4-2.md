# Introduction
In this lab we covered Mutation Testing and GUI Testing. Building upon our prior experience with JFreeChart testing, the assignment challenged us to enhance our test suites through mutation analysis using Pitest, where we evaluated mutation coverage, identified equivalent mutants, developed detection strategies, and expanded test cases to increase scores by at  10% for both Range and DataUtilities classes. In the GUI testing component, we used Selenium IDE to design and automate test cases for  websites, using verification points and comparing Selenium with Sikulix. Through this  lab, we gained understanding of test suite effectiveness measurement and automated testing and developing  skills in both mutation analysis and GUI test automation.



# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
1. Mutant: Incremented (a++) double field lower: SURVIVED
Mutation: The lower field of the Range class is incremented after its value is used.
Behavior: This mutation does not affect the calculation of the central value because the increment happens after the value is used.
Reason for Survival: The test suite likely does not verify the state of the lower field after the method call, allowing the mutant to survive.

2. Mutant: Incremented (a++) double field upper: SURVIVED
Mutation: The upper field of the Range class is incremented after its value is used.
Behavior: Similar to the first mutant, this mutation does not impact the central value calculation.
Reason for Survival: The test suite does not check the state of the upper field after the method call.

3. Mutant: Decremented (a--) double field lower: SURVIVED
Mutation: The lower field is decremented after its value is used.
Behavior: The decrement does not affect the central value calculation.
Reason for Survival: The test suite does not verify the state of the lower field after the method call.

4. Mutant: Decremented (a--) double field upper: SURVIVED
Mutation: The upper field is decremented after its value is used.
Behavior: The decrement does not affect the central value calculation.
Reason for Survival: The test suite does not verify the state of the upper field after the method call.
5. Mutant: Substituted 2.0 with 1.0: KILLED
Mutation: The divisor 2.0 in the central value calculation is replaced with 1.0.
Behavior: This changes the calculation from (lower + upper) / 2.0 to (lower + upper) / 1.0, effectively removing the division.
Reason for Killing: The test suite likely includes assertions that verify the correct central value, which would fail when the divisor is incorrect.

6. Mutant: Replaced double division with multiplication: KILLED
Mutation: The division operation in the central value calculation is replaced with multiplication.
Behavior: The calculation changes from (lower + upper) / 2.0 to (lower + upper) * 2.0.
Reason for Killing: The test suite detects the incorrect result because the expected central value is not matched.

7. Mutant: Replaced double addition with subtraction: KILLED
Mutation: The addition operation in the central value calculation is replaced with subtraction.
Behavior: The calculation changes from (lower + upper) / 2.0 to (lower - upper) / 2.0.
Reason for Killing: The test suite detects the incorrect result because the expected central value is not matched.
8. Mutant: Replaced double division with modulus: KILLED
Mutation: The division operation is replaced with the modulus operation.
Behavior: The calculation changes from (lower + upper) / 2.0 to (lower + upper) % 2.0.
Reason for Killing: The test suite detects the incorrect result because the expected central value is not matched.

9. Mutant: Replaced double addition with multiplication: KILLED
Mutation: The addition operation is replaced with multiplication.
Behavior: The calculation changes from (lower + upper) / 2.0 to (lower * upper) / 2.0.
Reason for Killing: The test suite detects the incorrect result because the expected central value is not matched.
10. Mutant: Replaced double return with 0.0d: KILLED
Mutation: The return value of the method is replaced with 0.0.
Behavior: The method always returns 0.0 instead of the calculated central value.
Reason for Killing: The test suite detects the incorrect return value.

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes
Based on the coverage scores and mutation scores range class has high scores which suggest its a strong test suite. On the other hand DataUtilities has a low percentage for both categories which is an indicator that it is not as strong of a test suitr. 
# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
Equivalent mutants significantly affect mutation score accuracy because they cannot be killed by any test case despite being syntactically different from the original code they lower the score by increasing the total mutant count without representing actual test suite weaknesses. These functionally identical mutations make it so that testers have to manually check the surviving mutants to see whihc are true test gaps from equivalent ones. Increasing analysis effort while  misleading quality checks. 
# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
One effective method to detect equivalent mutants in the classes is by analyzing branch coverage before and after mutation testing.If a mutant does not alter branch coverage, it likely does not introduce new behavior. This approach benefits from automation, reducing the need for manual inspection and improving efficiency in detecting equivalent mutants. However, a disadvantage is that it assumes the test suite provides enough coverage. If test cases are not sufficent, some non-equivalent mutants may be misclassified as equivalent..This method operates on the assumption that any change in a program’s behavior will be reflected in the execution paths taken during testing.This is not always the case, especially when mutations affect portions of the program that are not directly observable through test execution. For example, mutations that change internal optimizations, logging, or floating-point precision may not affect control flow but could still produce differences in behavior.Also, if a mutation affects some part of code that is not tested enough, it may not be caught even though it is a significant change.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
Mutation testing is a  technique used to test the effectiveness of a test suite by intentionally introducing small faults (mutations) into the code and checking whether the tests detect them.

Advantages of Mutation Testing:
- Measures the fault-detection capability of tests rather than just execution coverage.
- Reveals test cases that execute code but fail to detect injected faults.
– Helps developers add stronger assertions and edge-case tests.
- Forces deeper analysis of whether certain code changes affect behavior.
- ensure tests are not just passing but actually meaningful.

Disadvantages of Mutation Testing
- Generates many mutants, requiring significant execution time.
– Some mutants may not change program behavior making them hard to detect lowering scores.
– Determining why a mutant survived can be time consuming.
- High mutation scores don’t guarantee bug-free code

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
Selenium 
Advantages:
- Browser Compatibility
- Language Support 
- Web-Specific Features
– Can run tests without a GUI for faster execution.

Disadvantages:
- Limited to Web Apps – Cannot automate desktop or mobile applications.
- No Image Recognition – making it unreliable for CAPTCHAs or canvas-based UIs.

Sikulix 
Advantages:
- Automates desktop, mobile, and embedded applications.
- Image Recognition – Can interact with UI elements using screenshots
- Simple Scripting
 
Disadvantages:
- Slower Execution – Image matching is computationally intensive.
- Small layout changes break scripts.
- Limited Browser Support

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
We split the work by having one pair work on mutation test for Range class and one pair work on mutation test for Data Utilities class and 23 had each person make 2 test for the GUI and web based scripting test. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
The hard part of this lab was the mutation testing we really had to take alot of time to expand our test cases making sure we covered all boundaries. But this really opened our eyes to how diffiucly testing can be and it was fun to use these testing tool like mutations to see how strong our tests really are. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
As the start navigating through the lab was pretty hard and somehwat confusing. Since it was divided into different sections of what needed to be done, we had a hard time understanding at first. However, after coming together and carfully reviewing each step it became easier to navigate.
